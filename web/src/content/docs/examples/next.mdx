    ```

3.  Initialize Tailwind CSS in your project:

    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

4.  Create a `styles/globals.css` file with the following content:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

5.  Import the `globals.css` file in your `app/layout.tsx`:

    ```js
    import "../styles/globals.css"

    //...
    ```

6.  Follow the main [Setup guide](../setup) to install `tailwindest` and generate your `tw.ts` file.

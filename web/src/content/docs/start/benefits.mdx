## 1. Type-safety

Bringing a type system to Tailwind was the overarching goal of this project.
Let's take a look at how you can benefit from type stability with tailwindest.

### Get type definition of `tailwind`

```ts
type TailwindClass = Tailwindest[keyof Tailwindest]
```

### Infinite nest condition

`typescript`'s recursive type computation allows you to write infinite Nested Break conditions.

```ts
const autocompleted = tw.style({
    after: {
        before: {
            file: {
                "first-letter": {
                    "first-line": {
                        marker: {
                            placeholder: {
                                selection: {
                                    active: {
                                        autofill: {
                                            backgroundColor:
                                                "after:before:file:first-letter:first-line:marker:placeholder:selection:active:autofill:bg-red-500", // <-- We can strictly type this value
                                        },
                                    },
                                },
                            },
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
})
```

## 2. Great Readability

Design an **intuitive, primitive, familiar API** is essential process.
Final conclusion is going back to the most primitive form, as if we were writing down pure `CSS`. And this led to the conclusion that the CSS in JS form is the best fit.

:::note
Most of the `tailwindcss` **properties name is based on pure `CSS`
properties,** except `tailwind`'s sole utility properties like `mx-1`.
:::

```ts
const box = tw.style({
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "flex-row",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    justifyContent: "justify-center",
    gap: "gap-2",

    margin: "mx-2",
})
```

### Colocate nest conditions

In pure `tailwind`, you should write nest conditions like this.

```ts
const smConditions =
    "sm:flex sm:items-center sm:justify-center sm:p-2 sm:m-2 sm:border sm:rounded-sm"
```

As you can see, the `sm:` expression is repeated. But in tailwindest, you can colocate nest conditions in one `object`.

```ts
const easyToRead = tw.style({
    sm: {
        display: "sm:flex",
        alignItems: "sm:items-center",
        justifyContent: "sm:justify-center",

        padding: "sm:p-2",
        margin: "sm:m-2",

        borderWidth: "sm:border",
        borderRadius: "sm:rounded-sm",
    },
})
```

## 3. Reusability

tailwindest handles `string`. That means, we can reuse all the elements of function.

### Reuse all elements

```ts
const box = tw.style({
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "flex-row",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    justifyContent: "justify-center",
    gap: "gap-2",
})
```

1.  **classname**: **`string`**

    get classname

    ```ts
    const boxClass = box.class()
    // flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-2
    ```

2.  **styleSheet**: **`object`**

    extract styleSheet

    ```ts
    const boxStyle = box.style()
    /**
    {
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "flex-row",
        alignItems: "items-center",
        justifyContent: "justify-center",
        gap: "gap-2",
    }
    **/
    ```

**`classname` and `styleSheet` are just `string` and `object`.** So you can
modifying it whatever you want.

Tailwindest is a lightweight and fast **className generation library** only for tailwindcss.
With type safety, maintainable class names, and maximized reusable style designs,
you can make more robust products.

## Classname generator

The fact that tailwindest is a `string` generator gives it the following advantages.

1.  **Tiny bundle size, 768B**
2.  **Independency of framework and environment**
3.  **Zero compile steps**

## Elegant conditional styling

The easiest way to understand conditional styling is to **think of switches**.
We're surrounded by them all the time: we turn lights on and off, and our beloved keyboards are all switches. **Conditional styling can also be thought of as a type of switch** (albeit a physical one).

### Toggle switch

The simplest switch is a `toggle`, which can only express two states: on/off. Let's use this concept in programming.
You need to create a button that supports dark/light mode, i.e and **its style should change depending on the value of a boolean variable called `isDarkMode`**.
It's like a light switch: pressing it (on = `true`) turns it on (light mode), pressing the other side (off = `false`) turns it off (dark mode).

![toggle concept](/images/toggle.png)

```ts /toggle/ /truthy/ /falsy/
const themeBtn = tw.toggle({
    base: {}, //    base style definition
    truthy: {}, //  dark mode style
    falsy: {}, //   light mode style
})
```

```tsx /isDarkMode/
const ThemeBtn = ({ children }) => {
    const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false)

    return <button className={themeBtn.class()(isDarkMode)}>{children}</button>
}
```

### Rotary switch

But in the real world, we can't express everything with a toggle switch, so we need to create a switch that's a step more complex: a rotary switch. If you've ever used a microwave oven, it's easy to understand! From steps 1, 2 to 10, we can fine-tune the time and intensity we want with a rotary switch.
So, for example, if we want to present a UI with 4 states: default, success, failure and pending, we can import the concept of a rotary switch: if it's success, we can associate a style for success, if it's failure, we can associate a style for failure, and so on.

![rotary concept](/images/rotary.png)

```tsx /default/ /success/ /error/ /pending/
const button = tw.rotary({
    base: {}, //    base style definition
    default: {}, // default style
    success: {}, // success style
    error: {}, //   error style
    pending: {}, // pending style
})
```

```tsx
const Button = ({
    children,
    type = "default",
}: {
    children: ReactNode
    type: GetVariants<typeof btn>
}) => {
    return <button className={button.class()(type)}>{children}</button>
}
```

### Combination of rotary, variants

However, there may be times when we need a few more states. In other words, we may need to **create multiple rotary switches** to represent more complex states.
This is where the `variants` comes in.

`variants` are **combinations of rotary switches** - think of the **microwave at home**. You'll notice that it has a few rotary switches, such as **time** and an **intensity**.

<div class="w-full md:w-2/3 mt-4">![microwave](/images/microwave.png)</div>

Similarly, with variants, you first create a category of switches for each of the criteria you need to adjust, and then just combine them.

![variants concept](/images/variants.png)

```tsx /type/ /size/ {5-8, 11-13}
const button = tw.variants({
    base: {},
    variants: {
        type: {
            default: {},
            success: {},
            error: {},
            pending: {},
        },
        size: {
            sm: {},
            md: {},
            lg: {},
        },
    },
})
```

```tsx /className/
interface BtnProps extends GetVariants<typeof btn> {
    children: ReactNode
}
const Btn = ({ children, type = "default", size = "md" }) => (
    <button
        className={btn.class()({
            type,
            size,
        })}
    >
        {children}
    </button>
)
```

## Pros and cons

### Pros

1.  **Type-safety**
2.  **Readability**
3.  **Reusability**
4.  **Maintainability**

### Cons

1.  Takes a little longer to write style
2.  Verbose than original tailwind

### Conclusion

The great thing about tailwind is that **it makes it quick and easy to get your product** done. But it introduces new problems: **readability** and **maintainability**.
In contrast, tailwindest can't get your product done any faster than regular tailwind. It **specializes in designing products that are easy to refactor and robust style**.

Now just combine the best of both worlds

:::note
if your `className` is too long to maintain, write it with tailwindest, but
if it's short and easy to read, write an inline `className`.
:::

If you apply tailwindest in the right circumstances, you can build a much more robust product with tailwind.

## Real world adaptation

1.  **Short `className`**: `inline-class`
2.  **Complex & Reusable `className`**: tailwindest

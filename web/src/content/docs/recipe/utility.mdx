## `mergeProps`

`mergeProps` can be used when you want to apply a specific `tailwind` property to a style.

> api reference, [`mergeProps`](/apis/mergeprops)

### When to use?

For example, let's say you've created a common container component called `Box`.
What you want to do is dynamically change only the `borderColor` property of the box, while maintaining the unique style you've defined for the Box.
So you create a `borderColor` props for `Box` component and add the desired color, and it's applied.

```tsx /borderColor/
import { tw } from "~/tw"
import type { Tailwindest } from "~/tw"

const box = tw.style({
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    borderWidth: "border",
    borderColor: "border-blue-300",
    // more box styles here...
})

interface BoxProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    borderColor?: Tailwindest["borderColor"]
}
export const Box = ({ children, borderColor }: BoxProps) => {
    // ass borderColor as props
    return <div className={`${box.class()} ${borderColor}`}>{children}</div>
}
```

Now you're thinking, "I can perfectly apply any `borderColor` with types.".
In most cases, you'll see that it works perfectly, but in some cases, it doesn't.

```tsx {1, 4}
// border color is red-300
const Works = () => <Box borderColor="border-red-300">love</Box>

// border color is not gray-100
const NotWorks = () => <Box borderColor="border-gray-100">love</Box>
```

### Problem

This happens because the order of `border-color` property in the `css` file generated by `tailwind`
doesn't work as you wrote it down: in the `className` of the Box, **`borderColor` is obviously last**, but in the **generated `css`, it's not last**.
The order of the `css` is generated in the order predefined by the `tailwind` framework, so it doesn't work as expected.

```css filename="generated.css" /border-gray-100/ /border-blue-300/ /border-red-300/
/* ... */

.border-gray-100 {
    border-color: "~100";
}

/* ... */

.border-blue-300 {
    border-color: "~300";
}

/* ... */

.border-red-300 {
    border-color: "~300";
}

/* ... */
```

### A: Merging properties

The solution is simple. If the `borderColor` props are passed, clear the predefined `border-blue-300` property, and if not, keep it.

This is where `mergeProps` comes in. Unlike regular `tailwind`, tailwindest uses an `object`, so it has a `key`, which means we can just **overwrite the value with the same key** and be done with it.

```tsx
import { tw } from "@/tw"
import type { Tailwindest } from "@/tw"

const box = tw.style({
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    borderWidth: "border",
    borderColor: "border-blue-300",
    // more box styles here...
})

interface BoxProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    borderColor?: Tailwindest["borderColor"]
}
export const Box = ({ children, borderColor }: BoxProps) => {
    // ass borderColor as props
    return (
        <div
            className={tw.mergeProps(box.style(), {
                borderColor,
            })}
        >
            {children}
        </div>
    )
}
```

### B: Merging styleSheets

Or just merge all the styles with your `Tailwindest` type.

```tsx {3} /tw/
interface UniversalTextProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    tw?: Tailwindest
}
const UniversalText = ({ children, tw: twStyle }: UniversalTextProps) => (
    <p
        className={tw.mergeProps(
            text.style(),
            twStyle //   override new styleSheet
        )}
    >
        {children}
    </p>
)
```

Now `UniversalText` is **fully customizable via `tw` props**.

```tsx /tw/ /fontFamily/
const Some = (
    <UniversalText
        tw={{
            fontFamily: "font-mono",
        }}
    >
        It is UniversalText
    </UniversalText>
)
```

In this way, you don't need to install classname merging packages like `tailwind-merge`.

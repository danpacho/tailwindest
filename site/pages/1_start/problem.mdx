# Problems of tailwind

## 1. Type Safety

The first problem with `tailwind` is its lack of type safety.
While the `tailwind` Intellisense plugin goes a long way in solving this problem, it still falls short when it comes to typechecking classnames during the runtime or build process.

```tsx {2}
const FelxIsNotCorrect = ({ children }) => (
    <div className="flex felx-row">{children}</div>
)
```

As demonstrated in the above example, the `tailwind` Intellisense plugin is unable to identify the mistake of using `felx` instead of `flex`. This is because **the classname could be anything**.

## 2. Difficulty in Reusing Styles

`tailwind` offers a method for reusing styles, as described in their official documentation, but it can be quite challenging.

The recommended way to reuse styles is by separating them into components and using loops in frameworks or multi-cursor editing in editors. Additionally, you can extract reusable classes using @apply.

```css /@apply/
@layer components {
    .btn-primary {
        @apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400 focus:ring-opacity-75;
    }
}
```

The example above demonstrates how you can reuse the btn-primary classname using `@apply`.
However, it's important to note that **using `@apply` creates an additional layer of abstraction over `tailwind`'s abstraction**, which can make the code more complex and harder to maintain.

## 3. Horizontal Classname Issues

`tailwind` can become challenging to read if the number of classes exceeds a certain point, in my opinion `10`. Furthermore, if there are additional break conditions like dark or hover, it can make things even messier and harder to read.

```tsx {2}
const Box = ({ children } => (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-4 m-4 bg-white rounded-md md:p-6 md:m-6 hover:bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:hover:bg-neutral-800">
        {children}
    </div>
))
```

This problem **can become a technical debt** when it comes to refactoring the code over time. Developers may need to read through all the classnames slowly, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

# Utility

## `mergeProps`

`mergeProps` can be used when you want to apply a specific `tailwind` property to a style.

> api reference, [`mergeProps`](../5_apis/mergeProps)

### When to use

For example, let's say you've created a common container component called `Box`.
What you want to do is dynamically change only the borderColor property of the box, while maintaining the unique style you've defined for the Box.
So you create a `borderColor` props for `Box` component and add the desired color, and it's applied.

```tsx /borderColor/
import { wind, type Tailwind } from "@/wind"

const box = wind({
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    borderWidth: "border",
    borderColor: "border-blue-300",
    // more box styles here...
})

interface BoxProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    borderColor?: Tailwind["borderColor"]
}
export const Box = ({ children, borderColor }: BoxProps) => {
    // ass borderColor as props
    return <div className={`${box.class()} ${borderColor}`}>{children}</div>
}
```

Now you're thinking, "I can perfectly apply any `borderColor` with types.".
In most cases, you'll see that it works perfectly, but in some cases, it doesn't.

```tsx
// border color is red-300
const Works = () => <Box borderColor="border-red-300">love</Box>

// border color is not gray-100
const NotWorks = () => <Box borderColor="border-gray-100">love</Box>
```

### Problem

This happens because the order of `border-color` property in the `css` file generated by `tailwind`
doesn't work as you wrote it down: in the `className` of the Box, **`borderColor` is obviously last**, but in the **generated `css`, it's not last**.
The order of the `css` is generated in the order predefined by the `tailwind` framework, so it doesn't work as expected.

```css filename="generated.css"
/* ... */

.border-gray-100 {
    border-color: "~100";
}

/* ... */

.border-blue-300 {
    border-color: "~300";
}

/* ... */

.border-red-300 {
    border-color: "~300";
}

/* ... */
```

### Solution

The solution is simple. If the `borderColor` props are passed, clear the predefined `border-blue-300` property, and if not, keep it.

This is where `mergeProps` comes in. Unlike regular `tailwind`, `tailwindest` uses an `object`, so it has a `key`, which means we can just **overwrite the value with the same key** and be done with it.

```tsx
import { wind, type Tailwind } from "@/wind"

const box = wind({
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "items-center",
    borderWidth: "border",
    borderColor: "border-blue-300",
    // more box styles here...
})

interface BoxProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    borderColor?: Tailwind["borderColor"]
}
export const Box = ({ children, borderColor }: BoxProps) => {
    // ass borderColor as props
    return (
        <div
            className={mergeProps(box.style(), {
                borderColor,
            })}
        >
            {children}
        </div>
    )
}
```

Congratulations. It's now working! As an alternative to `mergeProps`, you can use a package like `tailwind-merge`.
The downside is that it increases the bundle-size by about `6.5KB`. Use the right technique in the right situation.
